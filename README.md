# FraudDetection-LLM-Integration
This project implements an end-to-end fraud detection system using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection. It flags potentially fraudulent transactions and employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate human-readable explanations for each flagged case, enhancing transparency and user trust in the detection process.
