# End-to-End Fraud Detection System with LLM Explanations

Welcome to my project on building an advanced fraud detection system that leverages cutting-edge techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs)! ðŸš€

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to improve fraud detection accuracy and transparency. It starts with the Isolation Forest algorithm, which identifies unusual transactions that may indicate fraud. What sets this system apart is the integration of a pre-trained LLM, which generates clear, natural language explanations for flagged transactions. This makes fraud detection easier to understand and more actionable.

## Key Features
* Isolation Forest to detect outlier transactions (potential fraud).
* LLM integration to provide natural language explanations for each flagged transaction.
* Utilizes a Kaggle credit card fraud dataset for real-world training and validation.
* Flexible to work with other models like logistic regression to optimize false positive rates (FPR).

## Why This Matters
By explaining the logic behind flagged transactions, this system helps teams quickly make informed decisions and adapt their strategies or writing rules, reducing fraud losses while improving efficiency.

## Project flow

1. **Data Loading**

   I begin by loading and exploring the Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains transaction records with labels for fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, which we load using pandas. This step allows us to understand the data's structure and identify key features
Download the dataset directly from Kaggle due to its large file size (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data).

2. **Data Preprocessing**

    Preprocessing the data is a critical step before feeding it into the model. In this phase, we handle any inconsistencies and transform the data into a form suitable for machine learning models.

   Handle Missing Values: Checked for and imputed any missing data points.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Transformed categorical variables (e.g., gender) into numerical formats using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scaling Numerical Features: Scaled numerical features (like transaction amounts) to normalize the data. This step ensures that no feature disproportionately affects the model due to its scale.

4. **Train-Test Split**

    To properly evaluate the performance of the model, the dataset is split into a training set and a test set. This allows us to train the model on one portion of the data and then validate its performance on unseen data.

   Purpose:
   Splitting the data allows us to prevent overfitting and objectively evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. The model is trained on the training set and then tested on the holdout test set to measure how well it generalizes to new data.

5. **Train Isolation Forest Model**

   The Isolation Forest algorithm is an unsupervised learning method designed to detect anomalies. Since fraud is a rare event, anomaly detection is a great fit for this task.

   Purpose:
   The Isolation Forest algorithm isolates anomalies (fraudulent transactions) by randomly selecting features and partitioning the data. It is particularly effective in scenarios where normal data points vastly outnumber anomalies, as is the case with fraud detection.

6. **LLM Integration for Explanation**

    After the fraud detection model identifies suspicious transactions, we use a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) (such as GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) to provide human-readable explanations for each flagged transaction. This step enhances transparency and helps end-users better understand why a transaction was considered fraudulent.

   Purpose:
   Using LLMs in fraud detection adds a layer of explainability, which is critical for user trust and compliance. Instead of just flagging a transaction, the system can now provide meaningful context, making it easier for financial institutions and users to understand the reasons behind the modelâ€™s decision.

7. **Evaluation**
8. 
   Once the model has flagged potentially fraudulent transactions, we need to assess its performance. For this, we use standard classification evaluation metrics.
   I will work on improving the model accuracy in future scope as the goal here is to learn how LLMs can be used in fraud detection.
   Purpose:
   Evaluation metrics are crucial in determining the effectiveness of the model. In fraud detection, we are particularly interested in precision (how many flagged transactions were actually fraudulent) and recall (how many fraudulent transactions were successfully identified). The F1-score combines both metrics into a single value, providing a balanced measure of the modelâ€™s performance.

9. **Display Results**

   Finally, we present the results of the system by showing the flagged transactions alongside the explanations generated by the LLM. Additionally, the evaluation metrics are displayed to give an overall sense of how well the model performed.

   Purpose:
   Presenting the flagged transactions with explanations provides actionable insights for users or financial analysts. Additionally, performance metrics give stakeholders a quantitative understanding of how well the system detects fraud.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning, combined with natural language processing (NLP), can be used to build a sophisticated fraud detection system. By using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and integrating LLMs for generating explanations, the system offers not only accurate fraud detection but also meaningful insights into the decisions made by the model.
