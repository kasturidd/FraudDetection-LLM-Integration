# End-to-End Fraud Detection System with LLM Explanations

This project aims to build a complete fraud detection system using anomaly detection techniques. Specifically, we use the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect potential fraud cases and integrate a pre-trained LLM (Large Language Model) to provide natural language explanations for flagged transactions. The system is designed to improve fraud detection and enhance interpretability for end users.

## 1. Data Loading
- **What we did:** Loaded the dataset from a CSV file using pandas and performed initial exploration.
- **Purpose:** Understand the dataset structure and identify key features, checking for inconsistencies.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
- **What we did:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
- **Purpose:** Ensure clean, properly formatted data for optimal model performance.

## 3. Train-Test Split
- **What we did:** Split the data into training and test sets (80/20 ratio).
- **Purpose:** Prevent overfitting and objectively evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

## 4. Train Isolation Forest Model
- **What we did:** Trained the Isolation Forest model on the training data to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Purpose:** Effectively isolate anomalies in a rare-event scenario like fraud detection.

## 5. LLM Integration for Explanation
- **What we did:** Generated prompts for flagged transactions and passed them to the LLM for natural language explanations.
- **Purpose:** Enhance transparency and help users understand the rationale behind flagged transactions.

## 6. Evaluation
- **What we did:** Generated a confusion matrix and computed metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Purpose:** Assess model effectiveness, focusing on precision and recall in fraud detection.

## 7. Display Results
- **What we did:** Displayed flagged transactions with LLM explanations and evaluation metrics.
- **Purpose:** Provide actionable insights and a quantitative understanding of system performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning, combined with natural language processing (NLP), can build a sophisticated fraud detection system, offering accurate detection and meaningful insights into decision-making processes.
