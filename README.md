# End-to-End Fraud Detection System with LLM Explanations

This project aims to build a complete fraud detection system using anomaly detection techniques. Specifically, we use the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect potential fraud cases and then integrate a pre-trained LLM (Large Language Model) to provide natural language explanations for the flagged transactions. The system is designed to improve fraud detection and enhance interpretability for end users.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Loading**

   The first step of the process involves loading the dataset into the environment and exploring its structure. For this project, we have used a public dataset containing transaction records, with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

   Purpose:
   This step is essential to understand the dataset you're working with, allowing you to prepare it for the machine learning pipeline. You'll identify key features and check for any potential issues, such as missing or inconsistent data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

    Preprocessing the data is a critical step before feeding it into the model. In this phase, we handle any inconsistencies and transform the data into a form suitable for machine learning models.

   Purpose:
   Data preprocessing ensures that the data is clean and properly formatted. Machine learning models are sensitive to missing values and unscaled features, so this step is critical for the model's performance and accuracy.

3. **Train-Test Split**

    To properly evaluate the performance of the model, the dataset is split into a training set and a test set. This allows us to train the model on one portion of the data and then validate its performance on unseen data.

   Purpose:
   Splitting the data allows us to prevent overfitting and objectively evaluate the model’s performance. The model is trained on the training set and then tested on the holdout test set to measure how well it generalizes to new data.

4. **Train Isolation Forest Model**

   The Isolation Forest algorithm is an unsupervised learning method designed to detect anomalies. Since fraud is a rare event, anomaly detection is a great fit for this task.

   Purpose:
   The Isolation Forest algorithm isolates anomalies (fraudulent transactions) by randomly selecting features and partitioning the data. It is particularly effective in scenarios where normal data points vastly outnumber anomalies, as is the case with fraud detection.

5. **LLM Integration for Explanation**
   After the fraud detection model identifies suspicious transactions, we use a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) (such as GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) to provide human-readable explanations for each flagged transaction. This step enhances transparency and helps end-users better understand why a transaction was considered fraudulent.

   Purpose:
   Using LLMs in fraud detection adds a layer of explainability, which is critical for user trust and compliance. Instead of just flagging a transaction, the system can now provide meaningful context, making it easier for financial institutions and users to understand the reasons behind the model’s decision.

6. **Evaluation**
   Once the model has flagged potentially fraudulent transactions, we need to assess its performance. For this, we use standard classification evaluation metrics.

   Purpose:
   Evaluation metrics are crucial in determining the effectiveness of the model. In fraud detection, we are particularly interested in precision (how many flagged transactions were actually fraudulent) and recall (how many fraudulent transactions were successfully identified). The F1-score combines both metrics into a single value, providing a balanced measure of the model’s performance.

7. **Display Results**
   Finally, we present the results of the system by showing the flagged transactions alongside the explanations generated by the LLM. Additionally, the evaluation metrics are displayed to give an overall sense of how well the model performed.

   Purpose:
   Presenting the flagged transactions with explanations provides actionable insights for users or financial analysts. Additionally, performance metrics give stakeholders a quantitative understanding of how well the system detects fraud.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning, combined with natural language processing (NLP), can be used to build a sophisticated fraud detection system. By using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and integrating LLMs for generating explanations, the system offers not only accurate fraud detection but also meaningful insights into the decisions made by the model.
